Steps followed
Import required libraries and create a data frame of the url
Identify feature and target variables, perform data cleaning by removing information that is not relevant to our study, implement feature engineering
Perform Exploratory Data analysis on the cleaned data using correlation to derive insights
The model is then trained on training data using a Simple Linear Regression Algorithm, and model performance is evaluated on testing data
Results verified with the insights
